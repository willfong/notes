# Development Notes

In no particular order:

1. **Never Trust User Data** - In general, you should verify all input data. But you should always verify anything that is sent by users. Must protect against malicious activity
1. **No Magic** - The priority is for code clarity for developers, not for computer optimization. Everything should be explicit.  No shortcuts. Shorthand looks like magic. Harder to read and add to. No need to save you from typing. Help developers reading your code.
