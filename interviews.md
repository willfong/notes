# Recruitment

## Screening

The initial screening process should be a questionaire about relevant topics a successful candidate should have knowledge about. 

Not useful:
- Excessive scrutiny of the resume
- Questionaires that are generic and can apply for every job


## Interview Questions

### Round 1 Interviews

The first round of interviews should generally be to get to know the candidate and verify the resume. 

- Ask questions that the candidate should know, like things on their resume. This helps the interviewer to verify the candidate's resume and see how deep the candidate can go.
- There is a fine line between what the candidate should know before entering the interview, and what new things they can learn after they get the job. 
- No reference questions. Things that can be looked up (for example, syntax) does not really demonstrates the candidate's skill, only their memorization.
